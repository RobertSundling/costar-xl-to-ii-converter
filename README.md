Vintage utility to convert raw CoStar LabelWriter XL printer data to LabelWriter II Plus format. Written by Robert Sundling in 2001.

## Overview and Motivation

This command-line tool was written to bridge the gap between a CoStar LabelWriter XL driver and an old LabelWriter II Plus printer, for which no modern Windows driver was available.

I used my LabelWriter II Plus printer for printing shipping labels for my shareware games, but when I upgraded to newer systems I found the LabelWriter II Plus was no longer supported by the CoStar LabelWriter drivers. Rather than buying a new printer, since mine was physically working fine, I decided the simplest way to get things working again was to just write a quick-and-dirty utility that would convert the output from the current driver to a format that the older printer could understand.

It receives the raw printer data from the CoStar LabelWriter XL printer driver then converts it to a compatible format for the older printer (including scaling the bitmap images, since the resolution of the II Plus was lower than the XL). The output can then be sent to a LabelWriter II Plus printer.

This allowed me to continue to use my old printer with the new drivers.

At the time [Ghostscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript) included a utility, [RedMon](http://www.ghostgum.com.au/software/redmon.htm), which creates a virtual printer port that can redirect output to any program. I used it to create virtual printer port on my Windows NT 4 server, setting it to redirect to this utility then pipe its output to the actual printer. I configured the CoStar LabelWriter XL driver, from my client computer, to print to that RedMon virtual port on the server. From there, everything worked automatically.

## Technical Details

This code was written in C++ for [Visual C++ 6.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/visual-c/6x). It wasn't written with the intent of being shared, but just as something to quickly solve an immediate problem. I haven't modified it since I got it working in 2001. You will find lots of commented-out debugging code that I used during development to test things. Once it worked, I didn't go back and clean it up.

For completeness, I have also included the original project and workspace files.

This code would likely be trivially modified to work with modern C++ compilers or other operating systems. I'd imagine that today this code would be primarily useful to study by those who want to print to a LabelWriter II Plus printer, or who want to decode data from a CoStar LabelWriter XL driver, not for anyone who actually wants to convert between the two.

The resampling code (from 203 to 136 dpi) is not likely useful. It's written in a weidly inefficient way because I was experimenting with different techniques--such as ORing pixels to ensure black ones wouldn't be missed--but ended up finding the best quality was had simply by choosing thicker fonts and resampling na√Øvely.

## Usage

Compile this, then using RedMon (or a similar utility), redirect the output from a LabelWriter XL driver into this program, and pipe its output to a LabelWriter II Plus printer.
